# Insertion Sort Algorithm

## Problem Breakdown & Computational Thinking (You can add a flowchart and write the
four pillars of computational thinking briefly in bullets)

## Steps to Run

### Manual Input

1. Type your list of numbers into the box labeled "input list", making sure to add a comma between each number.
2. Click the "Sort" button.

### Random Input

1. Manualy set the maximum and minumum potential values for the randomized numbers, as well as how many numbers you would liek to generate.
2. Clcik the "Randomize" button.
3. Hit the "Sort" button.

### Potential Error Tests

Tested: Inputting invalid characters (e.g. none numbers) | Result: Outputed error message (Not a code failing error message, just a failsafe when given inavalid inputs)

Tested: Setting random minimum value to be larger than the random maximum value | Result: Outputed error message (Not a code failing error message, just a failsafe)

Tested: Giving more than 20 numbers in the input | Result: Sorts the first 20 given numbers, and ignores any that follow
